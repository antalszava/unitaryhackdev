**Open bounty**: QuTiP and quantify-scheduler interface, link [here](https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-scheduler/-/issues/114), value: $100.

Quantify enables quantum computing users to program hybrid `gate-level` / `pulse-level` physics experiments:  
- in a hardware-agnostic manner through [`quantify-scheduler`](https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-scheduler) (currently supporting Qblox and Zurich Instruments `control hardware`), 
- and to automate `data acquisition` and execution of these experiments with [`quantify-core`](https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-core).
